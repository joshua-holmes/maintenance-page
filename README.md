# Maintenance Page

This is a simple maintenance page that you can use as a placeholder when your website is down. See the gif below for an example.

The character animation is a modified version of [Aakash Rodrigues' beautiful CSS animation](https://codepen.io/aakashrodrigues/pen/MWpRwz).

To use, download the `index.html` and `styles.css` files to your server, then have the server serve the `index.html` file. The CSS file should be in the same folder as the HTML file.
